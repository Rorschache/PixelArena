An internet game I'm developing now.Server-side is deployed on Tencent cloud server.Client-side uses ip and port to connect.It's not finished and I'll continuously add diffrent roles/weapons/maps.

2D shooting game.
You can choose your hero to fight against others,each hero has different abilities and properties.

Using lock-frame algorithm to make clients synchronized. 

Database choose MySQL on the server-side.

WAN connection is not perfect,I'd change TCP to UDP recently ,trying to solve the slightly unsynchronized problem.

LAN connection is much better,nealy perfect.But if you want to try,you have to set things up on the server-side like changing ip addrss;
